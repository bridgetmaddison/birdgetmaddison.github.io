					<p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy gets its name from its main themes - to
accept things that are out of your control and commit to changing things that
can be changed to make your life better. In summary, ACT uses mindfulness and
acceptance skills to develop a more flexible relationship with your thoughts,
feelings, memories and sensations. Time is also taken to clarify what gives
your life meaning, your values. Without being held back by tricky thoughts and
feelings and with a new sense of purpose and direction, you can begin to build
a more enriched and meaningful life.</p>

<p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (say Act, not A.C.T!!) is an engaging
and playful approach to tackling life&rsquo;s difficulties. Just like
traditional
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, it is underpinned by a growing body of
scientific evidence highlighting its effectiveness for many psychological
problems and challenges.</p>

<p>ACT draws on brain science to show we are all wired
to &lsquo;suffer&rsquo; or find life difficult because we are designed to pay attention to
anything we perceive as threat. This explains why we often find ourselves
caught up in our in our &lsquo;chattering&rsquo; mind, over-thinking ourselves, our
problems or disturbed by our feelings.  We are also programmed to find
solutions, to deal with the &lsquo;threat&rsquo;,  (in this case our thoughts and
feelings), so we are naturally compelled to distract ourselves from this tricky
stuff or avoid things that  lead them to show up in the first place.</p>

<p>This gets us caught up in unhelpful vicious cycles, like comfort eating,
relying on alcohol, retail therapy, spending too long watching shows,
checking social media, sleeping or overworking&hellip; the list is long!  In
Act we call this, The Struggle, when in an effort not to feel or think we
end up doing things or not doing things that take us away from the person
we want to be or the life we want to lead. (Clearly most of these things
are fine in moderation!). These ineffective coping strategies often play
a key part in maintaining things like anxiety, depression and low self
esteem and may cost us dearly in terms of time, energy, money, health and
relationships.</p>

<p>The research underpinning Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy shows that we
are also pre-programmed with the capacity to develop skills to work
through life&rsquo;s challenges..there is hope!!  In sessions you will learn
key skills to enable you to step back from your chattering mind and what
may be at times toxic thinking and learn ways to have and handle
uncomfortable or painful feelings.    Through mindfulness and acceptance
skills, use of metaphor, experiential exercises and the development of
self compassion, we will actively construct a new way for you to respond
to long-standing habits and reactions that you know are not helping. If
your life has grown narrower, we will draw on tried and tested
behavioural strategies such as Graded Exposure and Behavioural Activation
to enable you to move TOWARDS things you may have been avoiding.</p>

<p>These
skills help promote what ACT refers to as PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY,
which is all about trying to build a new relationship with difficult
thoughts, feelings and sensations, one that doesn’t rely on avoidance or
distraction. In essence, this means we are less stressed/distressed and
able to do more of what we value, giving us a greater sense of meaning,
purpose and therefore, well-being.</p>

<p>If battling with our difficulties pulls us away from how we want our
lives to be then getting things on track needs to take into account our
&lsquo;bigger picture&rsquo; – what is important to us in life. Taking time to
identify your values will enable you to set meaningful goals, giving you
a greater sense of purpose and can become a motivator when things are
tricky. From my experience this work also helps people appreciate what
they already have in their lives right now. Act is also a really
practical therapy of change so if moving forward involves learning new
skills or solving problems we can consider this too.</p>

<p><strong>The main principles of ACT can be summarised by this basic formula:</strong></p>

<p>A = Accept your thoughts and feelings and be present (accept them through      learning to handle them!)</p>

<p>C = Connect with your Values</p>

<p>T = Take effective Action</p>
