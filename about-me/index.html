<h2 id="referrals">Referrals</h2>

<p>I accept referrals from: individuals, GPs, Psychiatrists, Bupa, Vitality
Health, Aviva, Nuffield Health.</p>

<h2 id="current">Current</h2>

<p>I have 15 years of experience of working within the NHS, initially as a Mental Health
nurse until completing my Post Graduate Qualification in CBT in 2010. Alongside my
individual work with Clients I have enjoyed devising and facilitating an Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy Group Programme (ACT) which continues to run across the
County.</p>

<p>Following my decision to leave the NHS in 2018 I will work solely from the Beacon
Clinic from 2019 with individuals from 16 upwards and also offer a Group Therapy Programme - A
Wellbeing Therapy Workshop from the Beacon Clinic and in Worcester.</p>

<p>I have experience of providing Clinical Supervision within the NHS and externally. I
currently offer Supervision for those interested in building skills within the ACT Model.
This can be face to face or on Skype or Zoom.</p>

<p>I have a continuing commitment to best practice and regularly attend workshops
and Courses which support my professional development and contribute to my
ongoing Accreditation and Registration.</p>

<p>As an Accredited member of the British Association of Behavioural and
Cognitive Therapists and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, my work is
underpinned by the Professional Standards of Conduct and Ethics outlined by
these established organisations. I am also a member of the Association for
Contextual and Behavioural Scientists, which enables me to develop my practice
within the ACT model. I receive regular Clinical Supervision.</p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

<ul>
<li>Post Graduate Diploma in Cognitive and Behavioural Therapy, University Of Birmingham

Pin No. 00E0415W, 2003</li>
<li>Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Open University 1998</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<ul>
<li>2003: Following completion of my Mental Health Nursing Diploma, I worked on
an Acute Psychiatric Ward in Worcester, prior to moving to a Day Hospital
setting, where I worked with people individually and in groups.</li>
<li>2006: Joined Primary Care Mental Health Service in Worcestershire as a
Gateway Worker (this involved, mental health reviews, using CBT approach
interventions and signposting for other Services).</li>
<li>With a growing interest in developing my therapy skills I completed the
Postgraduate Diploma in CBT at the University of Birmingham in 2008-10. I am
now in my 5th year as an Accredited member of the BABCP (British Association
for Cognitive and Behavioural Psychotherapists). I continue to work with
adults from 16 upwards within the NHS and privately.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not working or learning, I&rsquo;m kept pretty busy with family, (I have 5
children, though 3 are grown up!), dogs, and garden. I also enjoy getting out
and about in our beautiful local countryside!</p>
