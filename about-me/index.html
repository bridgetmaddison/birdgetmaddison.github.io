<p>I have been working within Adult Primary Care Mental Services for just over 12

Wellbeing Centre In Malvern, Worcestershire.</p>

<p>Alongside my individual work with patients, I am a Clinical Supervisor within
the NHS. I am also involved with the development and facilitation of
group-work programmes, most recently devising and delivering Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy groups within the NHS.</p>

<p>I have a continuing commitment to best practice and regularly attend workshops
and Courses which support my professional development and contribute to my
ongoing Accreditation and Registration.</p>

<p>As an Accredited member of the British Association of Behavioural and
Cognitive Therapists and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, my work is
underpinned by the Professional Standards of Conduct and Ethics outlined by
these established organisations. I am also a member of the Association for
Contextual and Behavioural Scientists, which enables me to develop my practice
within the ACT model. I receive regular Clinical Supervision.</p>

<ul>
<li>2003: Following completion of my Mental Health Nursing Diploma, I worked on
an Acute Psychiatric Ward in Worcester, prior to moving to a Day Hospital
setting, where I worked with people individually and in groups.</li>
<li>2006: Joined Primary Care Mental Health Service in Worcestershire as a
Gateway Worker (this involved, mental health reviews, using CBT approach
interventions and signposting for other Services).</li>
<li>With a growing interest in developing my therapy skills I completed the
Postgraduate Diploma in CBT at the University of Birmingham in 2008-10. I am
now in my 5th year as an Accredited member of the BABCP (British Association
for Cognitive and Behavioural Psychotherapists). I continue to work with
adults from 16 upwards within the NHS and privately.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not working or learning, I&rsquo;m kept pretty busy with family, (I have 5
children, though 3 are grown up!), dogs, and garden. I also enjoy getting out
and about in our beautiful local countryside!</p>
